        <h5>Maintaining a toaster computer: the HP ProBook 4520s</h5>
        <p>This is my beloved toaster. A machine I found in the garbage a few years back. It was a sickly thing, with only 2GB of DDR3, 300GB of spinning rust, 
            and Windows 7 Home 32-bit. Even though this was a 64-bit machine. It was incredibly slow to start up, committed 80% of its memory to bloatware and Windows, 
            and promptly grinded to a halt the moment more than 4 browser tabs were open. It was a mediorce computer back in 2011 when it launched, 
            and when I found it in 2016, it was absolutely unusable.</p>
        <h6>And that was only the start.</h6>
        <p>This is sample text to test how the margins work and if they have been set correctly</p>
